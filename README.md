- Added menu screen with logo and 2 buttons for Overview and Roles
- the Overview button shows the Persons in list form and the Roles shows the roles of all persons
- the roles list whenyou click on it is kind of not working properly, its supposed to open and show all the persons with that specific role
- it also seems something went wrong at the last second so im now unsure if it works at all, will contact Joakim about it


To run:
1) Install dependencies: ```npm install```

2) Start the app: ```npx expo start```
